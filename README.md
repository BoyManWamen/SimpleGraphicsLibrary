## Description

This repository is a curated collection of my solutions to various LeetCode problems, implemented in C++. Whether you're a programming enthusiast, a student preparing for coding interviews, or a seasoned developer looking for efficient problem-solving techniques, you'll find a wealth of C++ solutions here.

## Getting Started

### Installing

Make sure to download cmake and ninja before compiling the program.

[Cmake](https://cmake.org/download/)

[Ninja](https://ninja-build.org/)

First, navigate to the directory you want to have your project.

```sh
cd path/to/your/directory
```

Next, clone the repository.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/BoyManWamen/SimpleGraphicsLibrary.git
```

Once you have cloned the repository, you can now move into the project directory.

```sh
cd SimpleGraphicsLibrary
```

Make the build directory.

```sh
mkdir build
```

You can create the executable with cmake.

```sh
cmake ../src/
```

```sh
cmake --build . -j
```

TGA files can be used as input for the executable in the obj directory.

```sh
./simplegraphicslibrary ../obj/{object_name}/{object_name.obj}
```
